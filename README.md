# Homecooks WebApp

## Running locally
````
git clone https://github.com/chaoticdenim/Homecooks
cd Homecooks
npm install
npm start
````

## Quick explanation
- Reusable components have been created in `src/components` (They are from Material Kit React)
- Everything in `src/views/` is the code for each page of the app. As you will see, we make use of modern HTML5 features, such as local storage and file selection.
- The "main" file exectued with **npm start** is `src/index.js`
